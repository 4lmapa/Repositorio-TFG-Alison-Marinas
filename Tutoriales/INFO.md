## What is Papercraft?


Papercraft is a technique that uses paper as an instrument to create all kinds of three-dimensional figures, similar to origami. However, it differs from this in that its patterns consist of many pieces of paper cut with scissors and attached with glue, which contradicts the philosophy of origami that only contemplates folding paper and never cut or paste it.

​

Currently the papercraft is a whole world with multiple variants and has become a discipline within the graphic design but the beginnings of this technique go back to the end of the First World War, when some publishing labels began to launch collectibles with paper models to assembly that included pieces of artillery and different warlike materials used by Germany or the USA.

​

Today there is a tendency to create own three-dimensional models, then transform them into two-dimensional patterns specially created so that, once cut, folded and pasted, they reproduce the initial three-dimensional model. For this, certain programs are used from which it is possible to import and convert 3D models of several templates, facilitating the design of paper models.

​

The programs necessary for the realization of a papercraf model are mainly the following:

​

1. Programs for creating the **3D model**, such as Blender, 3D Max Studio, etc.
2. Program for the creation of **textures** in the model, such as Photoshop, Inkscape, Gimp, etc.
3. Program to recreate the 3D model to **flat shapes**, such as Pepakura Designer.

​

Due to the low cost and simplicity of the digitalization of the patterns and their distribution for later printing, the Internet has become a popular means of exchanging these types of patterns.


## Laser Cutting and Papercraft


Thanks to the growing popularity of digital cutting and production techniques, an opportunity has been seen in the use of laser cutters to facilitate the tedious manual task of cutting the pieces that make up the 3D model on papercrafting.

​

To know step by step the realization of any model papercraft using a laser cutter, we will use the Stark Direwolf Sigil model created by [Gedelgo](https://www.deviantart.com/gedelgo/art/Stark-Direwolf-Sigil-Papercraft-566206042) as an example.

​

Gedelgo is an accomplished papercraft artist as we can see in [his](https://www.deviantart.com/gedelgo/gallery/54723625/Papercraft) gallery. To cut up his models he uses a specialized program, widely used in Papercraft world, called [Pepakura Designer](https://tamasoft.co.jp/pepakura-en/index.html), which create the unfold pattern of the model automatically in a PDO file.

​

In [one](https://www.deviantart.com/gedelgo/journal/Stuff-You-Might-Want-to-Know-About-Papercraft-528533435) of his posts you could find a brief summary of his workflow, from the creation of the 3D low poly model to its laser cutting, as some advices doing papercraft models.

​

In case you have downloaded a PDO template and you want to prepare it for laser cutting, check the following post where you can found a tutorial about how to create the DXF files from a Pepakura Designer file \(PDO\):

​

* [HOW TO: Create DXF files from a PDO file to laser cutting](https://wikifactory.com/posts/how-to-create-dxf-files-from-a-pdo-file-to-laser-cutting)

​

However, for those who don’t want to use Pepakura, in this project you'll learn how to use any CAD program \(Rhinoceros in this case\) to create the patterns from a 3D model and export them on DXF files to be used on a laser cutter.

​

Down below I leave a video about how the process would be carried out in a general way for this kind of projects. Take note that this method has a lot of applications such as [packaging](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdTmMVd4LUs&t=7s) design and cardboard and paper [prototypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gWk6br5Ngkc) among others.
